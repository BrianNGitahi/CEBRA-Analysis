# CEBRA Analysis 

This is a repository containing the perfomance analysis notebooks for CEBRA. 

* Models notebook is a notebook that documents the search for the best parameters for the CEBRA model to get ideal embeddings for both the circle and the Lorenz attactor
* Lorenz notebook is continuation of the Models notebook that looks more closely at the best parameters to use in obtaining embeddings for the attractor
* PCA_comp is a notebook that compares the output of 2D PCA and the CEBRA embeddings for the Lorenz attractor
* Dimensionality notebook is a notebook used to evaluate the performance of CEBRA models, starting with simple inputs
* d_library has helper functions to be used in the dimensionality analysis of the embeddings
* Animate embeddings is a notebook used to generate animations of the embeddings produced
